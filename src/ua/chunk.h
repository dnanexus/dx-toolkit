 * The variables below are used for computing instanteneous transfer speed: 
 *  1) instantaneousBytesAndTimestampQueue: A queue for keeping track of bytes transferred
 *     (and the timestamp for the same).
 *     (This queue is size limited to a fixed value (see chunk.cpp), so older
 *      values are constantly flushed out, giving an "instanteous" speed).
 *  2) sumOfInstantaneousBytes: maintains the sum of all bytes uploaded in current queue
 *     This allow us to computer average quickly (without traversing the queue and computing
 *     sum every time in uploadProgress function).
 *  3) instantBytesMutex: Mutex for above 2 variables.
 * Note: They are all intialized in chunk.cpp
