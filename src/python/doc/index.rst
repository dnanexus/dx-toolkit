DNAnexus Python Bindings
========================

The DNAnexus :mod:`dxpy` Python library provides Python bindings to
interact with the DNAnexus Platform via its API. The bindings are
available to Python apps running within the DNAnexus Execution
Environment, and can also be used in scripts you run that access the API
from the outside. Before you start digging in, you may want to take a
look at the `Introduction to the DNAnexus Platform
<https://wiki.dnanexus.com/Home>`_. The
following references may also be useful to you as you develop your own
scripts and apps.

`API Specification <https://wiki.dnanexus.com/API-Specification-v1.0.0/Introduction>`_
    Complete details on the API, the lifecycle of different data
    objects, project permissions, and more. Many methods in the bindings
    translate directly into API calls, so it will be helpful to have at
    least a general understanding of the API's structure.
`Execution Environment Reference <https://wiki.dnanexus.com/Execution-Environment-Reference>`_
    How applets and apps are run within the DNAnexus Platform.
`Developer Portal <https://wiki.dnanexus.com/Developer-Portal>`_
    Links to all other docs, e.g. useful command-line tools.
