:mod:`dxpy.app_builder` Module
------------------------------

This module contains high-level subroutines for creating app and applet
objects.

If you are developing apps, we strongly recommend that you use the command-line
application builder tools `dx-build-applet
<https://wiki.dnanexus.com/DxBuildApplet>`_ and `dx-build-app
<https://wiki.dnanexus.com/DxBuildApp>`_ to compile and deploy applets and apps
onto the platform. (Those command-line tools are implemented using the methods
in this module.)

.. warning:: This module is mostly intended for DNAnexus internal use. You
   probably only need to use the methods here directly if you are implementing
   a specialized development or publishing workflow that is not supported by
   the stock command-line builders.
