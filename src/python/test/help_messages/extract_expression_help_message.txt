                                   [path]

Retrieve the selected data or generate SQL to retrieve the data from a
molecular expression assay in a dataset or cohort based on provided rules.

positional arguments:
  path                  v3.0 Dataset or Cohort object ID, project-id:record-
                        id, where ":record-id" indicates the record-id in
                        current selected project, or name

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --list-assays         List molecular expression assays available for query
                        in the specified Dataset or Cohort object
  --retrieve-expression
                        A flag to support, specifying criteria of molecular
                        expression to retrieve. Retrieves rows from the
                        expression table, optionally extended with sample and
                        annotation information where the extension is inline
                        without affecting row count. By default returns the
                        following set of fields; "sample_id", "feature_id",
                        and "value". Additional fields may be returned using "
                        --additional-fields". Must be used with either "--
                        filter-json" or "--filter-json-file". Specify "--json-
                        help" following this option to get detailed
                        information on the json format and filters. When
                        filtering, one, and only one of "location",
                        "annotation.feature_id", or "annotation.feature_name"
                        may be supplied. If a Cohort object is supplied,
                        returned samples will be initially filtered to match
                        the cohort-defined set of samples, and any additional
                        filters will only further refine the cohort-defined
                        set.
  --additional-fields-help
                        List all fields available for output.
  --assay-name ASSAY_NAME
                        Specify a specific molecular expression assay to
                        query. If the argument is not specified, the default
                        assay used is the first assay listed when using the
                        argument, "--list-assays"
  --filter-json FILTER_JSON, -j FILTER_JSON
                        The full input JSON object as a string and
                        corresponding to "--retrieve-expression". Must be used
                        with "--retrieve-expression" flag. Either "--filter-
                        json" or "--filter-json-file" may be supplied, not
                        both.
  --filter-json-file FILTER_JSON_FILE, -f FILTER_JSON_FILE
                        The full input JSON object as a file and corresponding
                        to "--retrieve-expression". Must be used with "--
                        retrieve-expression" flag. Either "--filter-json" or "
                        --filter-json-file" may be supplied, not both.
  --json-help           When set, return a json template of "--retrieve-
                        expression" and a list of filters with definitions.
  --sql                 If the flag is provided, a SQL statement (as a string)
                        will be returned for the user to further query the
                        specified data, instead of returning actual data
                        values. Use of "--sql" is not supported when also
                        using the flag, --expression-matrix/-em
  --additional-fields ADDITIONAL_FIELDS [ADDITIONAL_FIELDS ...]
                        A set of fields to return, in addition to the default
                        set; "sample_id", "feature_id", and "value". Fields
                        must be represented as field names and supplied as a
                        single string, where each field name is separated by a
                        single comma. For example, fieldA,fieldB,fieldC. Use "
                        --additional-fields-help" to get the full list of
                        output fields available.
  --expression-matrix, -em
                        If the flag is provided with "--retrieve-expression",
                        the returned data will be a matrix of sample IDs
                        (rows) by feature IDs (columns), where each cell is
                        the respective pairwise value. The flag is not
                        compatible with "--additional-fields". Additionally,
                        the flag is not compatible with an "expression"
                        filter. If the underlying expression value is missing,
                        the value will be empty in returned data. Use of
                        --expression-matrix/-em is not supported when also
                        using the flag, "--sql".
  --delim DELIM, --delimiter DELIM
                        Always use exactly one of DELIMITER to separate fields
                        to be printed; if no delimiter is provided with this
                        flag, COMMA will be used. If a file is specified and
                        no --delim argument is passed or is COMMA, the file
                        suffix will be ".csv". If a file is specified and the
                        --delim argument is TAB, the file suffix will be
                        ".tsv". Otherwise, if a file is specified and "--
                        delim" is neither COMMA or TAB file suffix will be
                        ".txt".
  --output OUTPUT, -o OUTPUT
                        A local filename to be used, where "-" indicates
                        printing to STDOUT. If -o/--output is not supplied,
                        default behavior is to create a file with a
                        constructed name in the current folder.
