    # The following line creates the job that will perform the
    # "postprocess" step of your app.  We've given it an input field
    # that is a list of job-based object references created from the
    # "process" jobs we just created.  Assuming those jobs have an
    # output field called "output", these values will be passed to the
    # "postprocess" job.  Because these values are not ready until the
    # "process" jobs finish, the "postprocess" job WILL NOT RUN until
    # all job-based object references have been resolved (i.e. the
    # jobs they reference have finished running).
    #
    # If you do not plan to have the "process" jobs create output that
    # the "postprocess" job will require, then you can explicitly list
    # the dependencies to wait for those jobs to finish by setting the
    # "depends_on" field to the list of subjobs to wait for (it
    # accepts either dxpy handlers or string IDs in the list).  We've
    # included this parameter in the line below as well for
    # completeness, though it is unnecessary if you are providing
    # job-based object references in the input that refer to the same
    # set of jobs.

    # If you would like to include any of the output fields from the

    # return { "app_output_field": postprocess_job.get_output_ref("answer"), ...}
    #
    # Tip: you can include in your output at this point any open
    # objects (such as files) which will be closed by a job that
    # finishes later.  The system will check to make sure that the
    # output object is closed and will attempt to clone it out as
    # output into the parent container only after all subjobs have
    # finished.
