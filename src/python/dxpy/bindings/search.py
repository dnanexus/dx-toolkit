This module provides methods for finding existing objects and entities in the
DNAnexus Platform. The :func:`~dxpy.bindings.search.find_data_objects` function
provides search functionality over all data objects in the system. The
:func:`~dxpy.bindings.search.find_jobs` function can be used to find jobs
(whether they are running, failed, or done).
