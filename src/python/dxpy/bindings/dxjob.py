DXJob Handler
+++++++++++++

Jobs are DNAnexus entities that capture an instantiation of a running
app or applet. They can be created from either
:func:`dxpy.bindings.dxapplet.DXApplet.run` or
:func:`dxpy.bindings.dxapp.DXApp.run` if running an applet or app, or
via :func:`new_dxjob` or :func:`DXJob.new` in the case of an existing
job creating a subjob.

    :param instance_type: Instance type on which the job will be run, or a dict mapping function names to instance type requests
    :type instance_type: string or dict

    :type depends_on: list
    :param details: Details to set for the job
    :type details: dict or list
    :rtype: :class:`~dxpy.bindings.dxjob.DXJob`

    Creates and enqueues a new job that will execute a particular
    function (from the same app or applet as the one the current job is
    running). Returns the :class:`~dxpy.bindings.dxjob.DXJob` handle for
    the job.

    Note that this function is shorthand for::

        dxjob = DXJob()
        dxjob.new(fn_input, fn_name, name, instance_type)

    .. note:: This method is intended for calls made from within
       already-executing jobs or apps. If it is called from outside of
       an Execution Environment, an exception will be thrown. To create
       new jobs from outside the Execution Environment, use
       :func:`dxpy.bindings.dxapplet.DXApplet.run` or
       :func:`dxpy.bindings.dxapp.DXApp.run`.

    .. note:: If the environment variable ``DX_JOB_ID`` is not set, this method assmes that it is running within the debug harness, executes the job in place, and provides a debug job handler object that does not have a corresponding remote API job object.
