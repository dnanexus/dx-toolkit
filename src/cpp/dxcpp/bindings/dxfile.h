  //! A remote file handler.

  ///
  /// A File represents an opaque array of bytes (see the <a
  /// href="https://wiki.dnanexus.com/API-Specification-v1.0.0/Files">API specification</a> for more
  /// info). DXFile supports multithreaded uploading and downloading for high performance.
  ///
  /// When a File object is initialized, it is empty, in the "open" state, and writable. In order to
  /// support reliable upload of large files, File objects in the DNAnexus Platform may be written in
  /// multiple parts (possibly in parallel). After you have written all the data you like to the
  /// File, you may <em>close</em> it. The File goes into the "closing" state for finalization. Some
  /// time later, the File goes into the "closed" state and can be used for reading.
  ///
  /// There are three important rules to remember:
  /// - A file in the <b>"open"</b> state can only be used for writing (no "reads"). See: is_open()
  /// - A file in the <b>"closing"</b> state is unusable until it moves into the "closed" state. See: waitOnClose()
  /// - A file in the <b>"closed"</b> state can only be used for reading data (no "writes"). See: is_closed()
  ///
  /// You can write a File object in the following ways, which you may <b>not</b> mix and match:
  ///
  /// - If you are generating a single stream of output, use write() (and flush() when you are done
  ///   writing all the data). %DXFile automatically buffers your data, splits it into parts, and
  ///   uses parallel HTTP requests to upload them to the Platform. Requests to %write() only block
  ///   when the internal buffers are full and all threads are busy.
  /// - If you prefer to have explicit control of parallel writes, you can use uploadPart(). This
  ///   allows you to generate the file data out of order (you can specify a part ID to be associated
  ///   with each write, and the parts are concatenated in increasing order of part ID in order to
  ///   produce the final File). Each uploadPart() call makes one HTTP request and blocks until that
  ///   part has been written.
  /// - Use the static function uploadLocalFile() to write the contents of a local file to a File
  ///   object.
  ///
  /// When you are finished writing data to the File, call close(). If you wish to wait until the
  /// File has been closed before proceeding, you can supply the <code>block=true</code> parameter to
  /// close(); call waitOnClose(); or poll the File's status yourself, using describe().
  ///
  /// To read files, do one of the following (these may all be used concurrently and operate
  /// independently of each other):
  ///
  /// - Use startLinearQuery() to start fetching data in the background in fixed-size chunks (in
  ///   parallel), and getNextChunk() to read it.
  /// - Use read() and gcount() to read from the file (%gcount() returns the number of bytes that
  ///   were read). Use eof() to detect the end of the file and seek() to position the cursor
  ///   manually.
  /// - Use the static function downloadDXFile() to write the contents of a File object to a local
  ///   file (this uses parallel HTTP requests for faster download).
