DNAnexus Platform SDK
=====================

* **To download pre-built packages for your platform, see https://wiki.dnanexus.com/Downloads.**

* **Found a bug? See [Reporting Bugs](#reporting-bugs) below.**

Welcome to the `dx-toolkit` repository! This repository contains the DNAnexus
API language bindings and utilities for interacting with the DNAnexus platform.

See https://wiki.dnanexus.com/ and http://autodoc.dnanexus.com/ for relevant
documentation.

Installing the toolkit
----------------------

First, see the section "Build dependencies" below and install the appropriate
dependencies for your platform.

To build the toolkit, simply run ```make```.

Then, initialize your environment by sourcing this file:

```
source dx-toolkit/environment
```

You will then be able to use ```dx``` (the [DNAnexus Command Line
Client](https://wiki.dnanexus.com/Command-Line-Client/Quickstart)) and other
utilities, and you will be able to use DNAnexus API bindings in the supported
languages.

Supported languages
-------------------

The Platform SDK contains API language bindings for the following platforms:

* Python (requires Python 2.7)
* C++
* Perl
* Java
* R

Build dependencies
------------------

The following packages are required to build the toolkit. You can avoid having
to install them by either downloading a compiled release from
https://wiki.dnanexus.com/Downloads, or by building only a portion of the
toolkit that doesn't require them.

**Note:** There is a known incompatibility (in compiling dxcpp) when using GCC 4.7 with Boost 1.49. Please either use the GCC 4.6 series, or Boost 1.50+.

### Ubuntu 13.10

    sudo apt-get install make python-setuptools python-pip python-virtualenv python-dev \
      g++ cmake libboost1.54-all-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev zlib1g-dev libbz2-dev flex bison \
      autoconf

### Ubuntu 13.04

    sudo apt-get install make python-setuptools python-pip python-virtualenv python-dev \
      g++ cmake libboost1.53-all-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev zlib1g-dev libbz2-dev flex bison \
      autoconf

### Ubuntu 12.10

    sudo apt-get install make python-setuptools python-pip python-virtualenv python-dev \
      g++ cmake libboost1.50-all-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev zlib1g-dev libbz2-dev flex bison \
      autoconf

### Ubuntu 12.04

    sudo apt-get install make python-setuptools python-pip python-virtualenv python-dev \
      g++ cmake libboost1.48-all-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev zlib1g-dev libbz2-dev flex bison \
      autoconf

### Ubuntu 10.04

Install Python2.7. Python 2.7 is not available natively on Ubuntu 10.04, but
Felix Krull maintains the [deadsnakes
PPA](https://launchpad.net/~fkrull/+archive/deadsnakes), which includes a build
for Ubuntu 10.04. You can install Python from there as follows (as root):

    echo "deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/fkrull/deadsnakes/ubuntu lucid main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/deadsnakes.list
    apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys 5BB92C09DB82666C
    apt-get install --yes python2.7 python-pip python-setuptools-deadsnakes
    pip-2.7 install virtualenv

Since this repo doesn't contain the Python C headers, you will need to remove
the following compiled modules from the dependencies.

    sed -i -e '/psutil/ d' src/python/requirements.txt
    sed -i -e '/xattr/ d' src/python/requirements_dxfs.txt

The `xattr` module in particular is needed for the FUSE module. To use the
features provided by these modules on Ubuntu 10.04, you will need to arrange
for one of the following:

* Install the Python 2.7 C headers, and then skip the `sed` steps above to
  allow the affected modules to be built from source.
* Install the affected modules (`psutil` and `xattr`) in binary form.

Install boost 1.48 or higher (at least the ```filesystem```,
```program_options```, ```regex```, ```system``` and ```thread``` libraries).
This version of boost is not available natively on Ubuntu 10.04. You can use
the script ```build/lucid_install_boost.sh```, which installs it
into ```/usr/local/lib```.

The following additional dependencies are also needed:

    sudo apt-get install make g++ cmake libcurl4-openssl-dev zlib1g-dev \
      libbz2-dev flex bison autoconf

### CentOS 5.x/6.x

Install Python 2.7. Python 2.7 is not available natively on CentOS 5 or 6. You
can use the script ```build/centos_install_python27.sh```, which installs it
into ```/usr/local/bin```.

Install boost 1.48 or higher (at least the ```thread``` and ```regex```
libraries). This version of boost is not available natively on CentOS 5 or 6.
You can use the script ```build/centos_install_boost.sh```, which installs it
into ```/usr/local/lib```.

Then:

    yum install cmake libcurl-devel
    easy_install-2.7 pip
    pip-2.7 install virtualenv

Notes:

  - On CentOS 5.x, two of the utilities, ```dx-contigset-to-fasta``` and
    ```dx-reads-validator```, will not function correctly, as some of the
    library versions are too old.

  - Tested on CentOS 5.4 and CentOS 6.2.

  - TODO: Fedora/RHEL instructions; the CentOS instructions here may be a good
    starting point.

### OS X

Install the [Command Line Tools for XCode](https://developer.apple.com/downloads/). (Free registration required with Apple)

Install `pip` and `virtualenv` for Python:

    easy_install-2.7 pip
    pip-2.7 install virtualenv

Install the following packages from source or via [Homebrew](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/), [Fink](http://www.finkproject.org/), or [MacPorts](http://www.macports.org/):

* [CMake](http://www.cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html) (```sudo port install cmake``` or ```brew install cmake```)
* Boost >= 1.49 (```sudo port install boost``` or ```brew install boost```)
* GCC >= 4.6
    * On MacPorts, install and select GCC with:

        ```
        sudo port install gcc47
        sudo port select --set gcc mp-gcc47
        ```

    * On Homebrew, install and select an up-to-date version of GCC with:

        ```
        brew tap homebrew/versions
        brew install gcc47
        export CC=gcc-4.7
        export CXX=g++-4.7
        ```
* bison >= 2.7, autoconf, automake
  * On Homebrew: `brew install bison autoconf automake`
  * On MacPorts: `sudo port install bison autoconf automake`

### Windows
Warning: Not all parts of the SDK are compatible with Windows. Install the following dependencies to build the Upload Agent:

* [MinGW](http://www.mingw.org/), including `mingw32-libz-dev`, `mingw-zip`, and [`mingw-regex`](http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/Other/UserContributed/regex/mingw-regex-2.5.1/).
* [NSIS](http://nsis.sourceforge.net/)

Java bindings
-------------

The Java bindings are not built by default. See the [Java build
documentation](src/java/Readme.md) for more info.

[Javadocs](http://autodoc.dnanexus.com/bindings/java/current/) are available on
autodoc.dnanexus.com.

R bindings
----------

The R bindings (dxR) are not built by default.

### Build dependencies

* R (http://www.r-project.org/)
* R Packages:
    - RCurl
    - RJSONIO

### Building and Installing

You should install the `RCurl` and `RJSONIO` packages if you have not
already.  You can do so by running the following commands from within
R.

    > install.packages("RCurl")
    > install.packages("RJSONIO")

Next, run the following command from the command-line (outside of R)
to install the package from source.

    R CMD INSTALL dx-toolkit/src/R/dxR

You can use the `-l` flag to specify a local directory in which to
install the package if you do not have system permissions to install
it for all users.  If taking such an approach, you should set your
`R_LIBS` environment variable appropriately if you have not already.

    export R_LIBS='/home/username/path/to/dest/library'
    R CMD INSTALL dx-toolkit/src/R/dxR -l $R_LIBS

### Using the package

Once you have installed the library, you are ready to use it.  Inside
R, just run:

    library(dxR)

Ruby bindings
----------
The Ruby package is called `dxruby`.

### Build dependencies

* Ruby 1.8+
* rubygems
* git

#### Ubuntu
Use `apt-get install rubygems git` to build with Ruby 1.8, or `apt-get install ruby1.9.3 git make` to build with Ruby 1.9.

#### OS X
On OS X, dependencies may fail to install using Apple Ruby and the XCode toolchain. Instead, use `brew install ruby` to
install the [Homebrew](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/) Ruby 1.9.

### Building

    make ruby

### Using the package

The `environment` file will prepend to your `GEM_PATH` (see [Installing the toolkit](#installing-the-toolkit)). To use `dxruby`, run:

```
require 'rubygems'
require 'dxruby'
```

In Ruby 1.9, `require 'rubygems'` is not necessary.

Virtual filesystem support
--------------------------
Optional support is available for mounting DNAnexus Platform projects as virtual filesystems. Install the following dependencies:

Platform     | Dependency
-------------|-----------
Ubuntu 12.04 | `apt-get install libfuse2`
OS X         | [FUSE for OS X](http://osxfuse.github.io/)

See https://wiki.dnanexus.com/Virtual-Filesystem for more information.

Upload Agent
------------
See the [Upload Agent Readme](https://github.com/dnanexus/dx-toolkit/blob/master/src/ua/Readme.md) for Upload Agent build documentation.
