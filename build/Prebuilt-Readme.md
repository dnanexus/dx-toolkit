DNAnexus Platform SDK
=====================

* **Found a bug? See [Reporting Bugs](#reporting-bugs) below.**

`dx-toolkit` contains the DNAnexus API language bindings and utilities
for interacting with the DNAnexus platform.

See https://wiki.dnanexus.com/ and http://autodoc.dnanexus.com/ for relevant
documentation.

Using the toolkit on your system
--------------------------------

After unpacking the toolkit, initialize your environment by sourcing this file:

```
source dx-toolkit/environment
```

You will then be able to use `dx` (the [DNAnexus Command Line
Client](https://wiki.dnanexus.com/Command-Line-Client/Quickstart)) and other
utilities, and you will be able to use DNAnexus API bindings in the supported
languages.

Installing the toolkit from source
----------------------------------

Install any missing software dependencies. View the [Readme on Github](https://github.com/dnanexus/dx-toolkit/blob/master/Readme.md#installing-the-toolkit-from-source) for a list of the dependencies needed for your OS and version.
