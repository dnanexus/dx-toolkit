DNAnexus Platform SDK
=====================

**To build `dx-toolkit` from source, see https://wiki.dnanexus.com/Downloads.**

* **Found a bug? See [Reporting Bugs](#reporting-bugs) below.**

`dx-toolkit` contains the DNAnexus API language bindings and utilities
for interacting with the DNAnexus platform.

See https://wiki.dnanexus.com/ and http://autodoc.dnanexus.com/ for relevant
documentation.

Using the toolkit on your system
--------------------------------

First, see the section "Runtime dependencies" below and install the appropriate
dependencies for your platform.

After unpacking the toolkit, initialize your environment by sourcing this file:

```
source dx-toolkit/environment
```

You will then be able to use `dx` (the [DNAnexus Command Line
Client](https://wiki.dnanexus.com/Command-Line-Client/Quickstart)) and other
utilities, and you will be able to use DNAnexus API bindings in the supported
languages.

Supported languages
-------------------

* Python (requires Python 2.7)
* C++

If you wish to use bindings for the other supported languages (Java, R), please
see the [DNAnexus developer portal](https://wiki.dnanexus.com/Developer-Portal)
for specific instructions for your language. In general you can either build
from the source distribution, or install a prebuilt package specific to the
language.

Runtime dependencies
--------------------

### Ubuntu 14.04

    sudo apt-get install libboost-filesystem1.55.0 libboost-program-options1.55.0 \
        libboost-regex1.55.0 libboost-system1.55.0 libboost-thread1.55.0 libcurl3 \
        libbz2-1.0 zlib1g python-fuse python-pyxattr

### Ubuntu 12.04

    sudo apt-get install libboost-filesystem1.48.0 libboost-program-options1.48.0 \
        libboost-regex1.48.0 libboost-system1.48.0 libboost-thread1.48.0 libcurl3 \
        libbz2 zlib1g python-fuse python-pyxattr

### CentOS/RHEL 5.x/6.x

Install Python 2.7. Python 2.7 is not available natively on CentOS/RHEL
5 or 6. You can use the script `build/centos_install_python27.sh`, which
installs it into `/usr/local/bin`. (Run the script as root.)

Notes:

  - On CentOS/RHEL 5.x, one of the utilities, `dx-contigset-to-fasta`,
    will not function correctly, as some of the library versions are too
    old.

  - Tested on CentOS 5.4 and CentOS 6.2.

### OS X

Install the [Command Line Tools for XCode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/downloads/). (Free registration required with Apple)

Install the following packages, either from source or via [Homebrew](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/), [Fink](http://www.finkproject.org/), or [MacPorts](http://www.macports.org/):

* Boost >= 1.50 (`sudo port install boost` or `brew install boost`)
* GCC >= 4.6
    * On MacPorts, install and select GCC with:

        ```
        sudo port install gcc48
        sudo port select --set gcc mp-gcc48
        ```

    * On Homebrew, install and select an up-to-date version of GCC with:

        ```
        brew tap homebrew/versions
        brew install --enable-cxx gcc48
        export CC=gcc-4.8
        export CXX=g++-4.8
        ```
