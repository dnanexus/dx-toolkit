# * Setuptools bakes the path of the Python interpreter into all
#   installed Python scripts. Rewrite it back to the more portable form,
#   since we don't always know where the right interpreter is on the
#   target system.
#
# * Insert a stub that tries to detect when the user hasn't sourced the
#   environment file and prints a warning.
#
# * Force our Python path to appear before everything else in sys.path. This is
#   necessary when an out-of-date installation of Setuptools appears in
#   sys.path, providing a version of pkg_resources.py that is unable to read our
#   Python package requirements metadata, and crashes with a
#   pkg_resources.DistributionNotFound error.
